### Project features

- It was made with React.js, Css and React-Router



##Purpose

- Final Project for the React course at CoderHouse. Ecommerce based on a diet with products for vegans and celiacs.


##Code Process

- We started creating the app with npx create-react-app.

- Then we continue with the logic of the main components.

- We use material-ul icons.
- We installed boostrap to speed up the styles but most of it was done with css and styled components.

- We install react-router-dom and react-router to configure the project routes.

- We created a custom hook and a helper for ajax requests to facilitate the task.

- We develop the logic of the form.

- We import Firebase / app and create the environment variables (.env).

- We use Firebase / firestore to bring in products and then export our products to a new collection.
